    The symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is presented for a second order elliptical problem in 1d which yields a symmetric, positive definite
    bilinear form for a sufficiently positive penalty parameter. This guarantees existence and uniqueness of the discrete problem. Implementation and theoretical details are discussed.
    Numerical results confirm the optimal convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(h^{r+1})$ in the $L^2$-norm and $\mathcal{O}(h^r)$ in the energy norm for $\mathcal{P}^r$-elements. \\
    The elliptic case is consequently extended to a second order wave equation with time-dependent coefficients. In the spirit of the method of lines the problem is discretized in space using 
    symmetric interior penalty Galerkin finite elements and discretized in time using the explicit second-order leapfrog time integration. The resulting mass matrix is block-diagonal allowing 
    for a fully explicit and inherently parallel time-marching scheme.
